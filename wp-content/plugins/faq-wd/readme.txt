Having a responsive FAQ page is a necessity for most of the websites and the advanced WordPress FAQ plugin is the easiest wat to add unlimited FAQs and FAQ categories.

Using the FAQ WD plugin you can create unlimited amount of questions and answers. The free FAQ plugin will allow you to assign questions and answers into categories. The accordion FAQ view will allow displaying only the questions thus saving space and allowing the user to navigate to the relevant question. To make the question search even more user -friendlier, it is possible to display a FAQ-specific search box. 

The FAQ section sequence will be based on the Category order, which can be modified in Order section  using drag and drop functionality. Only the categories set within the shortcode will be displayed in the page/post allowing to use different categories for different pages within the site.
