== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= [Q] Why my images are not scaling on small screens in default layout =

[A] Slider background images for **default layout** are set with css – background-size: cover and it is best and usual way for setting background for containers because in that way image will be forced to cover entire container regardless of the image size. So, it is important to know that most of the time, parts of the slide background won’t be visible. The actual visible portion will vary depending on screen orientation and width/height aspect ratio. For instance, the common aspect ratio of portrait orientated tablets is 3:4 (iPad), and for desktop monitors it is 16:9 (full-HD resolution). In all instances the background is scaled to be as large as possible so that the slider area is completely covered by the background image. In simple words, some background clipping must occur, while the “content-safe” area is the very center of each slide – this area is always visible. Keeping this safe area in mind, if you are using slider background as an important part of your visual message, like an image showing your product for example, make sure that product is placed within that safe area so it won’t be clipped out.

= [Q] Why slider height is not applied for Responsive Images layout =

[A] **Responsive images layout** is taking the height of the tallest image. This way it will ensure the proper scaling of the images across devices, while keeping the proper proportions. This layout do not support layered elements, because the elements wouldn't fit in this layout, as on the smaller screens images can get really small in height. To add layers use **Default layout** which is displaying images differently on small devices, using background protpery. For more details how it works read the answer for the first question above.
